### Objectives
1) A heart monitoring center for remote long-term continuous monitoring of patients in their home environment outside of a hospital, based on wearable ECG sensors will shorten hospitalization time and prevent serious heart damages, providing better healthcare.
2) A large-scale demonstration of processing 10K simultaneous ECG data streams with real-time responses implementing efficient methods and approaches on HPC resources capable of processing several TFLOPS for computationally-intensive signal processing algorithms to classify arrhythmia is planned to be carried out.
3) Processing of millions of parallel threads needs a cloud-based HPC system and sophisticated architecture to process and efficiently orchestrate functions as a serverless data analytics platform with highly scalable throughput to minimize delays.
4) CardioHPC aims to improve the existing DL solution with advanced HPC services, as they cannot be computed with conventional computing resources.
